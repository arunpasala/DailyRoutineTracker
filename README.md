Daily Routine Tracker

Overview

The Daily Routine Tracker is a simple web application that allows users to add, manage, and track their daily tasks. Users can input their daily tasks, mark them as completed, and monitor their progress. The application stores the tasks locally on the user's browser using localStorage, ensuring data persistence even when the page is refreshed.

Features

Add Tasks: Users can add tasks with a single click.

Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed or uncompleted by clicking on them.

Progress Tracking: The application calculates the completion percentage and visually represents it with a progress bar.

Persistent Data: All tasks are saved in localStorage, so they remain available even after the page is closed or refreshed.
